# IntegerSorting
This java program rearranges integers from the lowest number to the highest number.

This program has two Java files: 1) Sorter.class and 2) SortMain.class

Sorter.class: This file comprises of the code that rearranges integers from low to high.
SortMain.class: This file consists of the "main method" that is in charge of executing the program.  

First, compile this program in your terminal with this command: javac SortMain.class 
Then you can run the program in your terminal with this command: java SortMain
Next, you'll be prompted by the program to decide how large an integer array you will like to create. And you will input those integers one by one, untill the entire array is filled. 
Finally, when the array is filled, the program will rearrange the integers from low to high and it will prompt you with the rearranged array. 

Thank you!
